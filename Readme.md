## Auth-Passport-Password-Reset Extension

This extensions adds password-reset by mail to `dpd-passport`.

### Requirements

* deployd (you'd have guessed that, probably :-))
* `dpd-passport`
* A SendGrid Account

### Installation

In your app's root directory, type `npm install dpd-passport-password-reset` into the command line or [download the source](https://bitbucket.org/simpletechs/dpd-passport-password-reset). This should create a `dpd-passport-password-reset` directory in your app's `node_modules` directory.

See [Installing Modules](http://docs.deployd.com/docs/using-modules/installing-modules.md) for details.

### Setup

Open your Dashboard and open the Passport-Auth Resource. 
Then configure the SendGrid API you want to use for sending out emails.

### Usage

Provide a `form` that `POST`s to `/auth/forgot-password`, where `auth` needs to be the name of your Passport-Auth Resource.
As a parameter you need to supply the `username`. The extension will then go ahead and use `dpd-email` to send out an email to Mandrill, which will in turn use your template and send it to the user.
